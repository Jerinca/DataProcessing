Analyzis about mean modus median and standard deviation:
When we look at the analyzis the first thing we see is that the standard deviation is way too high.
There for we will analyze the histogram first and make a new analyzes after we maybe dropped some data.

About the histogram:
When we make a histogram of the cleaned data we see a nice slope already.
There is something that is catching the attention though. 
The histogram is skewed right, but also it has one data point with a really high GDP.
Once we look up that value in our dataset (by index), we find the country 'Suriname'.
Since it is not likely that there are living only very rich people in Suriname, 
we can assume this datapoint is not correct.

To get a more reliable view of what the most likely GDP is, we have to create a new histogram.
One that will not contain that datapoint. 

Analyzis after making a new histogram:
After we have removed the uncorrect datapoint, we still have a skewed histogram.
But the value totally on the right side seems to be correct. The point represents Luxembourg.
Since Luxembourg is a pretty rich country we will leave it in. 

Furthermore we see a peak. The peak represents the GDP that is most frequent. In this case it is in between 500 & 800.
That takes us back to the shape of the histogram. The histogram is obviously still right-skewed.

We see that the standard deviation is way lower after dropping the outlier. Still pretty big but, not as before.

Conclusion:
The conclusion we can take is that there are way more countries with a lower GDP.
And fewer with a high GDP. But also we see that the difference is pretty big and it is not normally distributed.
That is also the reason why the average of the GDP is not even that low.
